    <!-- even after writing both paragraphs in same line and without line break,both outputs are on different lines -->
    <!-- this is because paragraph tag is block element -->

    <p style="border: 2px solid red;">this is paragraph one</p> <p style="border: 2px solid blue;">this is paragraph two</p>


    <!-- now we can see that both texts are appearing in the same line. -->
    <!-- It is because the span tag is an inline element.  -->
    <!-- this allows all the elements in the same line -->
    <span style="border: 2px solid rosybrown">this is span one</span> <span style="border: 2px solid green;">this is span two</span>

    <!-- Similarly we can find out about others html tags that whether they are block or inline. -->

    <!-- so div is also a block element -->
    <div style="border: 2px solid pink;">This is div one </div> <div style="border: 2px solid brown">this is div two</div>

    <!-- block element -->
    <li>this is line one</li> <li>this is line two</li>

    <!-- img is an inline element -->
    <img src="gym.jpg" alt="Error" width="540" height="360"> <img src="gym.jpg" alt="Error" width="540" height="360">
